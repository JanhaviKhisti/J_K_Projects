# Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring Near Transport Corridors

This project monitors and predicts air quality near transport corridors using pollution data (PM2.5, NO₂, CO, O₃). It uses a machine learning model to estimate AQI (Air Quality Index) and displays the results on a web-based dashboard.

---

## Project Features

- Ingest pollution data from CSV files
- Clean the data and compute AQI using a simplified formula
- Train a Random Forest machine learning model to predict AQI from pollutant levels
- Visualize pollutant trends using Streamlit
- Display real-time alerts on the dashboard based on AQI health categories
- Organized, modular structure for scalability
